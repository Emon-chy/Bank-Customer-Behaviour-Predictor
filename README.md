# Bank-Customer-Behaviour-Predictor
This simple neural network is built to predict whether a bank customer is gonna hold on to this bank or gonna take an exit from their service. The dataset is available in csv format.
I used the following libraries to build this neural network:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. keras
5. scikit-learn
